const posts = [{id:1,title:"Importance of English",content:`Until I was pursuing my master's degree, I considered English to be a mere formality—a fancy skill that people should know to make a good impression. I assumed I would secure a job in my hometown, surrounded by colleagues who spoke our native language exclusively.

Upon landing my job, my boss emphasized the immediate need to enhance my "English speaking skills" and "formal email writing." This was because many colleagues were comfortable communicating in English, and some even worked from the US/Canada, where our clients were also located.

Lesson learned: Possessing strong English communication skills is a fundamental requirement. Anyone working with businesses that have international clients or employees from diverse regions, including India, should be capable of expressing ideas clearly and concisely in English.

It's fortunate that I learned this lesson; having good English communication skills opens doors to more opportunities.

P.S.: This principle applies not just to English but to proficiency in other languages as well.

    content:`Here are some things I've learned by working with a senior developer:

    • End-to-End Ownership: Take responsibility for tasks from start to finish. This means understanding the requirements, identifying potential problems (corner cases), estimating the time needed, and figuring out how to complete it efficiently within the allocated timeframe.

    • Beyond Syntax: Knowing language syntax is crucial for smaller projects. However, as projects grow, you'll need to understand how large files are broken down into smaller, manageable units and how to import/export them for efficient code organization.

    • The Power of Testing: Writing test cases for your code is essential. This ensures your code functions as expected and helps catch errors early in the development process.
    
    • Designing Functions and Classes: Be able to design classes and functions effectively. This includes defining clear input and output parameters, identifying potential errors the function might throw, and considering how the "consumer" (the code using your function) will handle them. Always anticipate how the consumer will interact with your function/class.`
